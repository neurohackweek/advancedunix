This lesson will take participants through advanced usage of the Unix
programming environment, including powerful utilities such as `sed` and `awk`
and the versatile build system `Make`. Specific examples of using `Make` in
reproducible neuroimaging pipelines will be emphasized.

The template we have used to create these materials is based on the lesson template used in [Data Carpentry]({{ site.dc_site }})
and [Software Carpentry]({{ site.swc_site }}) workshops,
